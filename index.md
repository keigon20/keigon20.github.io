### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    I enjoyed Lab 3, part 3 because I remember coding a similar number guessing game with my dad. However, I wrote the game in python. So, I had a good understanding of the logic behind the code, but had to write it using C++. In this lab, we used if statements to compare the player 2's guess to player 1's number.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was memorible because it was the first lab where I learned to take arguments from the command line and use it in the program. Learning this was important because most of the labs after lab 5 required me to read command line arguments. I enjoyed this lab because I thought the concept of taking arguments from the command line and using it in the program was more efficient and interesting.
